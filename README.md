This Proyect is from a finals proyect I made when I took a Web Programming with Databases course in 1st Sophomore year semester of University. Its purpose is to run on a remote server and be able to update, remove and add values to different databases. In this case, they are called "Supplier", "User" and "Product".

I never got the proyect to work as intended but I may come back in the future to fix it.
